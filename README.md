Overview of the Project

Objective: Develop a text-to-speech conversion application that allows users to input text and generate corresponding audio output, supporting multiple languages and voice customization options.

Features:

Multiple Language Support: The application supports English, French, Japanese, Chinese, and Korean.
Text Processing: It includes language-specific processing, especially for Japanese and Chinese, to handle different scripts and language nuances.
Speech Synthesis: Utilizes Google Text-to-Speech (gTTS) to convert text into speech.
User Interface: Provides a simple GUI for user interaction, allowing text input and language selection.
Audio Playback: Plays the generated audio using the Pygame library.

Key Points
Modularity: The application is modular, separating concerns such as GUI management, text processing, and speech synthesis.
Error Handling: The code includes basic error handling to manage translation and file permission issues.
Extensibility: The architecture allows easy addition of new languages or text processing logic by extending the relevant modules.

This structure provides a foundation for developing a versatile text-to-speech application that can be expanded with additional features and improvements.
